# Lights-Out-Solver
Linear algebra final project

This program can solve the problem of the lights off game and finally gives the user the houses that must be pressed to turn off the entire screen.

How to solve this problem:

Each of the houses of the input matrix in any dimension can represent one of our Boolean equations, with which we can make the augmented matrix, and in which every house is one, that means if we press the house corresponding to the row on brightness  or The fact that that house is turned off has an effect, and then by using row reduction and finding the echelon and reduced echelon forms, we can finally find the answer to the problem and tell the user which houses he should press to solve the problem.
